# Assignment Instructions

You are going to build an app that uses Object-Oriented Programming principles.

Here are the requirements:

App should be landscape only
App should have two characters. Each character has:
HP
Attack Power
Name
This is a two player game so each character should have an attack button. When one player attacks, the other player/button is disabled for 3 seconds before they can attack
If a player dies, the screen should print who won
When the game ends, give an option to restart the game
Use Classes to build your game
The artwork has been provided as a resource.

FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO BE AMAZING:

Add sound fx for the attacks and death
Add some background music
When the game first starts allow each player to choose which character they want to be, the orc or the solider (ie you could have two soliders fighting each other or two orcs, etc)
Create a Game class that manages the game state (instead of using the view controller)
